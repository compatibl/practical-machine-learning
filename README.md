# Practical Machine Learning for Quantitative Finance

This repo contains code for the workshop practice sessions.

We will focus on two concepts in machine learning that hold great promise for
quant finance: regression models on Day 1, and generative models on Day 2. 

Each day, we will discuss theory during the first hour, and then use what
we learned to solve practical quant finance problems during the second hour.

During the practice sessions, we will review, update and run code on Colab and
AWS. Participants are welcome to just observe, or if desired  also participate 
in writing or running the code (participation is strictly optional). The code 
will be available on GitHub after the workshop.
