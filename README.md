workshop

### Practical Machine Learning for Quantitative Finance.

- Date: Monday 29th & Tuesday 30th March 2021
- Time: EDT: 9-11am / BST: 2-4pm / CEST: 3-5pm

# Agenda

We will focus on two concepts in machine learning that hold great promise for
quant finance: regression models on Day 1, and generative models on Day 2. 

Each day, we will discuss theory during the first hour, and then use what
we learned to solve practical quant finance problems during the second hour.

During the practice sessions, we will review, update and run code on Colab and
AWS. Participants are welcome to just observe, or if desired  also participate 
in writing or running the code (participation is strictly optional). The code 
will be available on GitHub after the workshop.

### Day 1 – Regression Models

- Regression model types
- Feedforward networks
- Autoencoders

Practice session: Estimation of Drift in Real-World Measure

### Day 2 – Generative Models

- Generative model types
- Joint and Conditional Probabilities
- Gibbs sampling

Practice session: Estimation of Probability in Real-World Measure
